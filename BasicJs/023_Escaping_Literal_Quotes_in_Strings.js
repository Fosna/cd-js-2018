// Homework

// What happens when you need a literal quote: " or ' inside of your string?
// var sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";
// When printed to console it writes: 

// Alan said, "Peter is learning JavaScript".


// Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:

// I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".

var myStr; // Change this line
